# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## Desc

> Given the **root** of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

> A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node

> down to the farthest leaf node

## Idea

> To solve this problem, we can simply use preorder traversal to traverse the whole tree and return the maximum height

## Complexity

### TC: O(n)

### SC: O(n)
