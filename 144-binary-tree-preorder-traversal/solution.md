# 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

## Desc

> Given the **root** of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values

## Idea

> The preorder traversal means for a given node, we will first visit itself

> followed by its left and right children

## Complexity

### TC: O(n)

### SC: O(n)
