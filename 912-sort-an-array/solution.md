# 912. Sort an Array

## Desc

> Given an array of integers **nums**, sort the array in ascending order and return it

> You must solve the problem **without using any built-in** functions in **O(nlogn)** time complexity

> and with the smallest space complexity possible

## Idea

> We can use **merge sort** to solve the question

> it uses Divide and Conquer technique

> it provides a worst tc **O(nlogn)** and require **O(n)** sc

## Complexity

### TC: O(nlogn)

### SC: O(n)
