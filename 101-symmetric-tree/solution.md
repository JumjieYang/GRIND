# 101. Symmetric Tree

## Desc

> Given the **root** of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself

## Idea

> We can perform the preorder traversal on the tree

> if the tree is a mirror of itself

> it's left part and right part should have the same value or same to be null

## Complexity

### TC: O(n)

### SC: O(n)
