# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

## Desc

> Given the **root** of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values

## Idea

> The inorder traversal means for a given node, we will visits it's left child first

> then visit itself, then visit it's right child

## Complexity

### TC: O(n)

### SC: O(n)
